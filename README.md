# Study Buddy
Study Buddy is a productivity-boosting website which contains features that allow you to learn to your utmost ability. It contains a bunch of tools which I used when studying for my exams/tests and so I put them into a single website for convenience. I have tried to include all the essential tools a person would require when learning so that he/she doesn't have to access multiple apps (thus creating a hectic environment) and encounter possible distractions ruining his/her precious study time.

Here are all the tools it provides:
### To-do list
You can create timed and untimed tasks, which upon completion give you something special
### Pomodoro Timer
Allows you to study for ideal amounts of time and then take short breaks, using a Pomodoro timer is scientifically proven to increase information retention and attention span
### Calendar
You can schedule events of exam days and days in which you should rest and relax to create the ultimate study plan
### Music Player
I found myself getting distracted using Spotify because I would get lost in the numerous options and waste time choosing a song, so I created a music player which by default plays focus-improving brown noise and binaural beats but also allows you to import music of your own choice, eliminating the visibility of the numerous options you would otherwise have.
### AI study assistant/mentor
You can chat to a friendly AI assistant called Mr. Mind, what makes Mr. Mind so special is that he has an actual personality, unlike other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. Mr. Mind has been programmed to not spoonfeed his 'students' and encourage problem-solving.
### Note-taking
Study Buddy provides a sophisticated note-taking feature involving books and pages, users can create books relating to general topics and write pages inside it relating to more specific topics, e.g. a book called Maths Study and a page inside it called Trigonometry.
### Study Sessions
Study Buddy also provides a feature called Study Sessions, if you click the Start Study Session Button, a timer will have started and everything done within the study session such as completed tasks and notes written will be recorded when the session is done, the tasks completed and an AI summary of your notes will be displayed allowing you to effectively assess your day.
### Study History
You can see your history of study sessions on the study history page, using this you can gauge how much you can learn in one day which I found particularly useful. You can also analyse what you had learned on the previous day to further strengthen your memory.
### Game store
Yes, you heard that right a game store. By completing tasks you get cash which you can use to buy games for a certain amount of time in the game store. I've included the most enjoyable (and addicting, but not too much) minigames, so you can spend your break times not indulging in social media.
